# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

# Logo Generator

## Description 
I created this content managment system (CMS) so the user could easily view and interact with information in a database. This is a command line application that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

## Usage
Open the terminal in the develope folder to get started. Once there, type in 'node index.js' and multiple propmts will appear. The user can view either the department, the role, or the emplyee, they can add a department, role or employee, and they can update an employee into a new role. When any new information is added, the table that was effected gets updated when reviewed. There is also a "quit" prompt to exit the main menu of options.
